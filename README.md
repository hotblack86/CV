I'm a full-stack junior software developer with a particular interest in
back-end development.
I very enthusiastic about coding and wish to develop this passion even
further.

My professional background has been in an unrelated field, but I relish a
challenge and am excited by the ever-increasing importance of coding in so many
aspects of life and the many possibilities that learning to code can offer.

I am looking to start a career in the tech industry of Brighton or London
where I can further grow as a Full-Stack developer and contribute to the success
and innovation of a company therein.

## Skills
Please see [This link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19mCW2facwDOzX0DQgoKbxra8t7JcsffOK9PntIvi4P4/edit?usp=sharing) for further evidence of the skills outlined below.
    

#### Problem Solving
  - The Makers course has refined my approach to problem solving as we were faced with challenges daily. For example, one project was to make a custom testing framework and use it to TDD an app. Although making this was both educational and rewarding, it of course doesn’t have the same functionality or usability as established frameworks. I was also still getting to grips with JavaScript at this stage of the makers course.
  To overcome these issues I utilised my debugging process, specifically using the console to manually test and console.log() to get visibility on my code.
  Helpfully there was a lot of online documentation on JS and I was able to effectively find relevant solutions.

  - My degree in Economics has given me a good basis in maths and analytics.
    These skills have frequently helped me to solve problems more quickly and
    smoothly than I otherwise would have.

#### Inquisitiveness and Enthusiasm
  - I love to learn and am dedicated to seeing projects through to the end,
    regardless of how challenging they are. Makers has helped to focus my
    abilities in both of these areas.

#### Quick Study 
  - Able to take on new technologies and learn new practices rapidly and efficiently. I actively sought out challenges during the Makers course, including producing our two week final project in Python and Pygame with no prior experience.

#### Communications
  - Clear presentation and written communication skills
  - Professional telephone manner – frequent customer interaction
    in former employment.

#### Teamwork
  - Makers really taught me the value of pair programming and agile processes. Our group projects involved daily standups,retros and checkins which help to unify the team.
  For instance a fellow Maker and team member said:- "As a team we embraced Agile working processes and James was fully committed to this. I loved his measured and well thought out contributions at our stand ups, clear commit messages, and speedy responses to pull requests with really helpful messages. I'd be super happy if I ever had the opportunity to work with James again.”
  -	Organised the Harveys Brewery team one year for the Lewes raft race.
  This utilised leadership and teamwork skills as well as mechanical and
  woodwork skills (to build the raft).
  -	Duke of Edinburgh award required team skills as well as navigational skills
  during the hiking and camping.
  - I'm comfortable adapting to whichever team role is required by a particular
    environment, whether that be leading or taking instruction from others.
