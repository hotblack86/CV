## James Hotblack

I'm a full-stack junior software developer with a particular interest in
front-end development.
I very enthusiastic about coding and wish to develop this passion even
further.

My professional background has been in an unrelated field, but I relish a
challenge and am excited by the ever-increasing importance of coding in so many
aspects of life and the many possibilities that learning to code can offer.

I am looking to start a career in the tech industry of Brighton or London
where I can further grow as a Full-Stack developer and contribute to the success
and innovation of a company therein.
